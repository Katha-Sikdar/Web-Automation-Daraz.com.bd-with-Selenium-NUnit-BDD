Using Selenium WebDriver with C#, NUnit, BDD Framework(Specflow)

## What is Automation?
In simple terms, Automation is the use of technology to perform tasks with reduced human intervention. In the world of Software Quality Assurance (SQA), it specifically refers to using software tools to execute tests, compare actual outcomes with predicted outcomes, and report the results.

## Importance of Automation - 
As an SQA engineer, you know that software moves fast. Manual testing alone often can't keep up with modern development cycles (like Agile or DevOps). Here is why automation is essential:
  - Speed and Efficiency
  - High Accuracy and Consistency
  - Better Test Coverage
  - Regression Testing
  - Cost-Effectiveness (In the Long Run)
  - Faster Feedback for Developers

## Why Selenium with C# NUnit, BDD Framework (Gherkin/Specflow)?
  - Selenium WebDriver: An open source tool for automating web browsers. It simulates real user interactions clicking, typing, and navigating to validate UI behavior.
  - NUnit: A powerful .NET unit-testing framework that provides
      - structure through annotations (Setup/Teardown)
      - handles assertions
      - supports parallel execution for faster results
      - easy integration with reporting tools (Allure)
